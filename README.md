# Flappy Bird Remake
Remake of Flappy Bird in C++. I am using the SFML library to produce the game.

### Controls
>Space Bar

This will cause the bird to jump

###Installation

For now, to play the remake you will need an IDE that has SFML included in its dependencies. I used Code Blocks.


I've learned a ton throughout this project. I grasped the concept of buffers called to the window.
The use of references and pointers in this context has made it easier to understand how to utilize them.
I've also learned how to use the different file classes such that they form an interdependent network.
